{"character": "Michael", "title": "Aren\u2019t the suggestions meant for you?", "body": "Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words."}

I am implying is that when we\u2019re on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.

Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also\u2026 illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Technically, he\u2019s right.", "body": "Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?"}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Because they\u2019re lame.", "body": "No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. Or the funny things that they can do, like \u201cwhere\u2019s the Beef?\u201d Yeah."}

{"character": "Michael", "title": "Well, I, I, I haven\u2019t been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.", "body": "Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you."}

{"character": "Michael", "title": "I think that I should help him get home.", "body": "No, No. Don\u2019t help him. He doesn\u2019t need help, Pam. What a nice guy."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.", "body": "I disagree, I think it was very valuable."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.", "body": "I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it."}

I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect.

{"character": "Michael", "title": "Now Dunder Mifflin has an arm\u2019s reach in all these small businesses all over the northeast. Now we\u2019re gonna take that arm, and we\u2019re gonna start selling printers.", "body": "I could manage my way around that."}

{"character": "Michael", "title": "I should step into sales myself.", "body": "Why, is there an untapped gay market?"}

{"character": "Michael", "title": "Really.", "body": "Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can\u2019t take the sales out of salesman."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.", "body": "No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people."}

{"character": "Michael", "title": "You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he\u2019s manager.", "body": "Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? Michael Scott, head of sales."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "You know, we really don\u2019t announce out loud our sales that much.", "body": "Why not? It\u2019s part of the sales experience."}

We\u2019re talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.", "body": "Well, then, why aren\u2019t you bugging me to fire everybody who\u2019s bad? You just want me to fire Luke.

{"character": "Michael", "title": "We have missiles too.", "body": "Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that\u2019s just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Actually, we\u2019re in a mild recession right now. I\u2019ll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems.

{"character": "Michael", "title": "Right, yes.", "body": "I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don\u2019t think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y\u2019know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don\u2019t tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend.

{"character": "Michael", "title": "Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that\u2026", "body": "Yeah!"}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "A party. It\u2019s not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.", "body": "Pam? Pam?"}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Hi guys.", "body": "Hi."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I\u2019ll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.", "body": "Uh, because you\u2019ve been on the Lam? Because the \u2018boring police\u2019 have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?"}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.", "body": "Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!"}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Okay, that\u2019s hurtful talk. We\u2019ve talked about that. You know, I don\u2019t interrupt your announcements.", "body": "You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?"}

{"character": "Michael", "title": "Yeah, uh, she\u2019ll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.", "body": "Hold on, Holly\u2019s coming back here?"}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Guys, who\u2019s Holly?", "body": "That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?"}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "She\u2019s one sassy black lady.", "body": "Holly\u2019s coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "I\u2019m not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.", "body": "You know what, we\u2019ll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Okay.", "body": "Cancel. We\u2019re canceling it."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "No, don\u2019t throw those out!", "body": "No, we have to cancel the party."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "We can save that.", "body": "No, no, no, we\u2019re gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new."}

{"character": "Michael", "title": "These cookies are fine.", "body": "It\u2019s not. They\u2019re not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Michael, Michael, wait we don\u2019t have, we don\u2019t have the budget for another party.", "body": "Well then everybody\u2019ll chip in, it\u2019ll be fine."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "I honestly think you\u2019re idealizing people here again, Michael. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna happen.", "body": "You know what, I\u2019ll pay for it. I\u2019ll pay for the party. It doesn\u2019t matter. This is way too important. People, Holly\u2019s coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Just stop moving your calves so much while you\u2019re talking.", "body": "Well, this year\u2019s gonna be different. We\u2019re gonna have fun. It\u2019s not gonna be tacky. It\u2019s going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It\u2019s not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It\u2019s gonna be cool, sleek Santa."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Maybe I\u2019ll bring my boyfriend. I\u2019ll invite him.", "body": "Okay. Sure."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "I mean, unless there\u2019s any chance there could be press at this party.", "body": "You never know about the press."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Well, I only ask because he\u2019s a senator.", "body": "Could he help us with some parking tickets?"}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate.", "body": "Well, then he\u2019s not a senator."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Yes, he is.", "body": "Okay."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "No, it has the little\u2026", "body": "Pam, no, no. Holly\u2019s coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it\u2019s a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Hi, I\u2019m looking for Michael Scott.", "body": "Yes, that\u2019s me. Come on it."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "I\u2019ve looked her up online\u2026 there\u2019s nothing about her. She\u2019s made no impression on the internet.", "body": "She doesn\u2019t need an internet presence, you just know."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Hey.", "body": "What the hell are you doing here? You\u2019re supposed to be in the courthouse."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "I can\u2019t talk about it or I\u2019ll get removed from the jury.", "body": "And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "I\u2019m really sorry, I can\u2019t help you. I\u2019m waiting for my boss\u2019 pretty friend to arrive.", "body": "There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God\u2019s sake?"}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Oh, you\u2019re Holly! Of course. Sorry.", "body": "Hello."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Well, well, well, if it isn\u2019t Michael Scott. You old bastard.", "body": "Well, I never thought I\u2019d see your face around these parts, you old bastard."}

{"character": "Michael", "title": "AJ gave me that.", "body": "Well, that\u2019s understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?"}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Mmhmm.", "body": "You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy\u2019s mom."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Why?", "body": "Because without Andy\u2019s mom, there\u2019s no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn\u2019t seen any of the Toy Story movies.", "body": "You\u2019re kidding me. Ahh!"}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "No. I know. I was like, \u201cWhat? Are you serious?\u201d", "body": "What a douche bag!"}

{"character": "Michael", "title": "Are you serious?", "body": "It\u2019s a sophisticated take."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "No, he doesn\u2019t. I told her Santa would be here.", "body": "Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Who told you that?", "body": "Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.", "body": "What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic."}
{"character": "Michael", "title": "Dwight\u2019s right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I\u2019m really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.", "body": "All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? Know who gave me this?

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Do you need anything?", "body": "Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. Let\u2019s go downstairs! Okay? Let\u2019s do it.", "body": "Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I\u2019d lock Mose in the chicken coop."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "We could get Deangelo flowers.", "body": "No, you can\u2019t get flowers for someone who\u2019s in a coma. They\u2019ll wilt before he wakes up."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons?", "body": "Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I\u2019m just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her\u2026 I don\u2019t want to mess this up, right? There\u2019s a consensus, people are happy.", "body": "Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. Jordan, gather my things from my desk."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "What have you done?", "body": "Mose\u2026 you\u2019ll never guess where I am right now."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Amen.", "body": "Excellent. Morning announcements! There\u2019s been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don\u2019t share it. Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Ooh, about what?", "body": "That\u2019s on a need-to-know basis."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I thought I needed to know for your calendar.", "body": "General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?", "body": "Define foment."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You define foment.", "body": "Please take note of the new color-coding system."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Oh my God, what is wrong with you?", "body": "Gotcha! Why are you late?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "It\u2019s none of your business, actually. It\u2019s very medical and personal.", "body": "All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Oh, it\u2019s just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It\u2019s just a club. Guys talking, you know.", "body": "You expect me to believe that you\u2019re starting a rebellion?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion.", "body": "Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Wow, you\u2019ve really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.", "body": "Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha\u2019s a rescue."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "And the desk.", "body": "The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein\u2019s desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I\u2019m a very busy man. Let\u2019s get right down to business."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Okay.", "body": "Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you\u2019ll be on your best behavior."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I promise\u2026d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so\u2026", "body": "Don\u2019t make me fire you."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You can\u2019t fire me. You\u2019re acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.", "body": "Don\u2019t make me pre-fire you."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You wouldn\u2019t dare.", "body": "Watch this. You\u2019re pre-fired. And when I\u2019m promoted, you\u2019ll be full fired."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "If you get promoted, and if you haven\u2019t fallen in love with me by then.", "body": "What?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I\u2019m good.", "body": "Everyone here thinks that you\u2019re a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won\u2019t last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you\u2019ll age swiftly and poorly."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Why are you telling me this?", "body": "Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don\u2019t want me to know abou- Ohh\u2026 it\u2019s a holster."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, are you carrying a gun?", "body": "The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don\u2019t know. I guess he\u2019s saying that he\u2019s proud of me."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.", "body": "The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can\u2019t walk around wearing an empty holster."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Why do you need to wear the holster at all?", "body": "Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You could put your cell phone in it instead.", "body": "Uh\u2026 hello!"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You could put a banana in it.", "body": "Why would I put a banana in my holster?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, no gun, okay? Don\u2019t make us call Jo.", "body": "Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out \u2013 aah!"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.", "body": "No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That\u2019s all we know! No. That\u2019s not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I can\u2019t reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.", "body": "Okay, why are you calling Jo?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I\u2019m gonna keep trying Jo.", "body": "Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "We all saw you do it.", "body": "Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy\u2019s tie look like?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Navy blue. Little red anchors.", "body": "I have no way of knowing if that\u2019s true."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this?", "body": "Okay, really?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I felt terrorized.", "body": "Come on."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Oh, there\u2019s a whole \u2018nother terrorism booklet for that.", "body": "I just really, really think we should handle this internally."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?", "body": "Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so\u2026 so important\u2026 to me. I love you guys. But don\u2019t cross me. But you\u2019re the best."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey. We\u2019re back.", "body": "There he is! Our hero! You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.", "body": "Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.", "body": "American Idol? What? No."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?", "body": "No."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?", "body": "Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.", "body": "I put everything back in the vending machine."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.", "body": "Okay."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I\u2019m on the spot. I don\u2019t know. Um\u2026 you know what? I think I\u2019m good.", "body": "Thank God."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Nope. When Jo\u2019s here, can you work in \u201cShagadelic, baby,\u201d at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?", "body": "What\u2019s jazz hands?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "...", "body": "Fine."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don\u2019t seem to know they\u2019re brothers.", "body": "Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic.", "body": "Well, what can you do? Life."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.", "body": "No, Kevin, come on."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.", "body": "Kevin, not now."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No, under the jacket.", "body": "You\u2019re kidding me. Oh God, what am I touching? It\u2019s moist."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I don\u2019t feel anything.", "body": "Oh, it\u2019s so wet."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Push harder, Dwight.", "body": "I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t push harder!"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher.", "body": "Okay, how\u2019s that?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.", "body": "I\u2019m kneading it!"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight! Walk me out. Let\u2019s talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it \u2013 it\u2019s nice to have a little power, eh? How\u2019s it feel?", "body": "Jo\u2026 I accidentally fired a gun in the office today."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "What?!", "body": "I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I\u2019ve ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse \u2013"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It\u2019s not even in the same \u2013 you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?", "body": "It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Beaumont-Adams is a girl\u2019s gun. That just makes it plain stupid.", "body": "I take full responsibility."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Who else would be responsible?", "body": "Pam made me put a banana in my holster."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You shot a gun off \u2013", "body": "Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius.", "body": "Got it."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I love you, Dwight. But you don\u2019t fit this job.", "body": "Jo, please\u2026 I will \u2013"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey, Dwight. What\u2019s up?", "body": "Shut up."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Should you really be so blatant about that?", "body": "They won\u2019t make me manager, and I won\u2019t settle for anything less. I\u2019ve gone about as far as I can here. That\u2019s obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?", "body": "Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I just did.", "body": "You can\u2019t."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No.", "body": "Now, listen,\u2026"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You\u2019re not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.", "body": "Okay, I know why you\u2019re saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand you want on the wheel."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Okay. That\u2019s vivid.", "body": "I\u2019m going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay?

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yes.", "body": "What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and\u2026 getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? That\u2019s a great question. I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Thank you, Dwight.", "body": "Thank you. You\u2019ll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you\u2019re gonna like the call you\u2019re going to receive. Oh, come on. I\u2019m just happy that I got this meeting."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No, no, no. Not ever, \u2019cause that\u2019s not gonna happen.", "body": "Well, it\u2019s not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone\u2019s getting a little power-mad."}

Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it\u2019s still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?", "body": "I can get you exotic meats \u2013 hippo steaks, giraffe burgers\u2026"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?", "body": "No, it\u2019s an accountability booster."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.", "body": "Jim, you\u2019re trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "We can\u2019t do this Dwight.", "body": "Smile\u2026nod. Smile and nod."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.", "body": "But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight\u2019s our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I\u2026", "body": "It\u2019s not a doomsday device, gosh. We can do this you guys."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Alright everybody, you are doing great!", "body": "Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she\u2019s hard at work."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, question.", "body": "No questions."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "If this doomsday device goes off\u2026", "body": "Accountability booster."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Nope.", "body": "No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha\u2026You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won\u2019t even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight we got five strikes.", "body": "Really?"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "What?!", "body": "You don\u2019t deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Ok Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.", "body": "Oh we know."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It\u2019s a pregnant Helen Mirren.", "body": "Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you\u2019re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "In this case yes.", "body": "No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No we\u2019re not.", "body": "Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That\u2019s right. You\u2019re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Okay. Uh, I don\u2019t. So are we good?", "body": "That\u2019s just absurd."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yes, because she\u2019s hot, right?", "body": "Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, am I hot right now?", "body": "Why would I or anyone else think that you\u2019re hot right now? I can\u2019t impregnate you, and that\u2019s the driving force between male-female attraction."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "What about before? Was I attractive before?", "body": "Meh\u2026 you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you\u2019re at an all-time low."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hmm. I think Jim\u2019s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.", "body": "You think Jim\u2019s lying? That\u2019s so cute. I know he\u2019s lying."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.", "body": "Done. I never touch a pregnant woman."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don\u2019t want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.", "body": "None taken. What do you got?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It\u2019s called being a nice person.", "body": "I don\u2019t see what\u2019s so ugly about him. He\u2019s got the broad face of a brewer."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Jim\u2019s on to me.", "body": "Hmm?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.", "body": "Just ugly enough to have deniability."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No, Kelly, don\u2019t.", "body": "The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "How\u2019d I get this long triangle?", "body": "Okay, just shut it."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Is he puffing out his chest?", "body": "I can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s unnaturally sunken. Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No. Maybe he just said something funny.", "body": "Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I think he\u2019s just making her laugh.", "body": "Time for me to find out."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Stop shoving me.", "body": "Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Uh, are you all in line?", "body": "Why don\u2019t you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? Now I\u2019m going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Wait, that\u2019s it? That\u2019s the question you\u2019re going to ask him?", "body": "We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No.", "body": "Yep, he\u2019s lying."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?", "body": "I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he\u2019s lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Wait, what?", "body": "Look at the numbers. Every single time, it\u2019s come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Why?", "body": "Oh, no big deal. It\u2019s just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida."}

So why doesn\u2019t everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it."}

This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you\u2019ve ever faced. They\u2019re gonna be hard, they\u2019re gonna be dirty. You\u2019re gonna wish you were dead."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "So, what is this special project?", "body": "Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "That sounds awesome.", "body": "It did, it did."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don\u2019t have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. Oh, don\u2019t write it down unless you like it.", "body": "Oh, I like it."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?", "body": "No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey, are you okay?", "body": "I\u2019m fine, okay? It\u2019s just stress. You know, \u2019cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Are you sure it\u2019s stress? Because I did poison you.", "body": "Very funny, Jim."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Oh no, I\u2019m serious. I was thinking, \u201cFor this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?\u201d and then I thought of it.

The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman\u2019s only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna\u2026 take a\u2026 brief pause at this point. Thank you. Oh, God.

Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I\u2019m not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters."}

This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions.

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "What\u2019s going on?", "body": "Party\u2019s over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn\u2019t real. It\u2019s me, Dwight!"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "For what it\u2019s worth, I liked your party better.", "body": "Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I don\u2019t think anyone thought that.", "body": "Jim couldn\u2019t even stay till the end of the party."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?", "body": "No, thanks. I\u2019ll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.", "body": "Shh. Let\u2019s not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I\u2019m gonna dig it out of the trash!"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "What are you wearing?", "body": "It\u2019s a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men\u2019s suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No.", "body": "Renters. Ok, I\u2019m gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let\u2019s get going.

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Once it\u2019s all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.", "body": "Oh sure, and when you\u2019re ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Put those away before you hurt yourself.", "body": "Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Is there a volume knob on that thing?", "body": "Yeah there\u2019s a volume knob on that thing."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, are you okay!?", "body": "Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s kicked in yet. I\u2019m gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?", "body": "Mmm. That\u2019s a good\u2026 question. 300 times\u2026 180\u2026 Um that comes to 25 minutes. Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.", "body": "Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh\u2026 No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I can\u2019t relate to that, my son hates my guts.", "body": "Oh\u2026 really."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that?", "body": "Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they\u2019re not even good. Really, they\u2019re bad. Like you and your son."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but\u2026 God I missed you!", "body": "What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Alright, that\u2019s enough, \u2018cause I can say some things about him too.", "body": "Yeah? Like what?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Like the time that you got drunk and, and then\u2026 Killed those kids on their way to prom!", "body": "That never happened. He\u2019s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught \u201csaving treats\u201d from the kitty litter box."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey, so I hear you\u2019re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?", "body": "That\u2019s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Well, uh\u2026 see, you raised it.", "body": "Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You know what, man? I deserve this job.", "body": "Mm-hmm."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond\u2026 and under.", "body": "You know what? You\u2019re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you\u2019re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You could\u2019ve just called that an alliance too, right?", "body": "I chose my words very carefully."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "There he is.", "body": "Hey. Come on, buddy. Let\u2019s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don\u2019t compare. When you\u2019re with the R-O-L-F, you\u2019re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I\u2019m on the phone. I\u2019m on the phone.", "body": "No doy!"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you\u2019re qualified to evaluate me?", "body": "Well, I\u2019m the one offering the job."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "What are your credentials?", "body": "I\u2019ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I\u2019m an Assistant to the Regional Manager."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I think I\u2019ve heard everything I need to hear.", "body": "Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d give a reference."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Ooh, okay. Didn\u2019t see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it.", "body": "Well, it\u2019s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Pass. Next one.", "body": "All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?", "body": "Oh, you think they\u2019re my only friends? I\u2019ve got way more friends than that, and they\u2019re all better than the losers who work here."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "People person.", "body": "It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Jim says he\u2019d like some say in the hiring process.", "body": "Really? That\u2019s interesting. \u2018Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who\u2019s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Okay. I can\u2019t say that that\u2019s not fair.", "body": "Sounds fair to me, David."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Oh, yeah, so we\u2019ll just do that later.", "body": "No. Why not do it now?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Uh\u2026 Well, it\u2019s about Athlead. I\u2019m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?", "body": "I\u2019d love to be in the loop, David."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yes, okay. Bye.", "body": "I\u2019d love to invest."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No, thanks.", "body": "I\u2019d like to give you $100 million."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, you can\u2019t just hire someone \u2018cause they\u2019re your friend.", "body": "I\u2019m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "They\u2019re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.", "body": "You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Do you want this paper?", "body": "I sure do."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "It\u2019s not very good.", "body": "I will pay you whatever it takes."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad.", "body": "No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It\u2019s over.", "body": "Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You\u2019re still at the 570 number?"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yeah, whether it\u2019s me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina\u2014", "body": "Or none of you"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you.", "body": "I wish I could hire all of you."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I\u2019m not looking south, I\u2019m not livin\u2019. That\u2019s what I always say.", "body": "Just act natural."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "But you know I wouldn\u2019t hire any of these all-stars.", "body": "Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it\u2019s your call."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?", "body": "I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn\u2019t picture any of them in the old gold and gray."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?", "body": "Yes. Thank you. Amazed."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I\u2019m sorry?", "body": "What? This is such bullcrap!"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.", "body": "Wow. So much crap. It\u2019s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Too much now.", "body": "Okay."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.", "body": "Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert\u2019s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don\u2019t open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe.", "body": "Guys, it wasn\u2019t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn\u2019t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I got it. Paintball.", "body": "Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life\u2019s big sunset, I can\u2019t help but wonder where it all went wrong. You\u2019ve all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city.", "body": "Thank you."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No, no, no. I\u2019m not moving back here. Are you crazy?", "body": "Of course you are."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Look. I, I don\u2019t want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it\u2019s just that farm life lacks a certain\u2026 sort of sophistication.", "body": "Oh my god."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I was just asking you something I didn\u2019t know.", "body": "Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you\u2019re gonna get made fun of a little bit."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I don\u2019t know any of that.", "body": "OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn\u2019t your father teach you anything?"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Well there you go. That\u2019s muy caliente.", "body": "OK, you are useless. I\u2019ll take care of this."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "What the hell?!", "body": "It\u2019s OK guys, she\u2019s no longer horny."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "What\u2019s her name?", "body": "Esther Ruger."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Sweet.", "body": "Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Oh yeah. Keep talkin\u2019.", "body": "Well, we\u2019ve been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls.", "body": "Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Let\u2019s talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I\u2019ll store it in one of my barns.", "body": "Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I\u2019m interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Esther, get in the truck.", "body": "Ok ok ok, wait! You win."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Standard.", "body": "Right, standard."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey, can I talk to you for one second?", "body": "No."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dude, we\u2019re being conned.", "body": "Go on."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "These chicks are way too hot to be into us. Esther\u2019s just pretending to like you so that you\u2019ll buy her daddy a new tractor.", "body": "No."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yes. Her sister\u2019s trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.", "body": "What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I don\u2019t even know what an auger is!", "body": "No woman would ever want a man who doesn\u2019t know what an auger is."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey, you ready to sign?", "body": "I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let\u2019s go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.", "body": "Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we\u2019re the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that\u2019s already been rode hard and put away muddy."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.", "body": "By hand."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, we need to talk.", "body": "I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything left for us to talk about, Esther."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Look, we\u2019re gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends.", "body": "No."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "So you\u2019re going to be paying more, but he\u2019s putting on ten times the miles and he\u2019s pocketing a profit behind your back.", "body": "That snake!"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don\u2019t shine.", "body": "That shady grove out by Willard\u2019s pond."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Mmhm.", "body": "So, you\u2019re fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Of course. You didn\u2019t just think I was tractor bait, did you?", "body": "No!"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey Dwight, what\u2019s an auger used for?", "body": "Post hole digging."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I don\u2019t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, \u201cRed Alert.\u201d", "body": "Well, the alert was already set to \u201cRed\u201d because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to \u201cDouble Red\u201d?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You own the building. Why can\u2019t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?", "body": "Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could\u2019ve met in the lobby. It\u2019s time to go out on a sale! Here we go."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Son, you\u2019ve lost your mind. I\u2019m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.", "body": "The buyer is your sister\u2019s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that\u2019s an order."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yeah, come on in. I\u2019m just on hold with another talent agency. It\u2019s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there\u2019s more. 251. 252. I can\u2019t even keep up!", "body": "Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That\u2019s final.", "body": "So what I\u2019m hearing you say is, \u201cMake Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible\u201d?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yes! I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m being curt, it\u2019s just I\u2019m about to land a top talent agent.", "body": "Mm-hmm. Good luck."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey, Dwight.", "body": "Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?", "body": "Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It\u2019s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha\u2014", "body": "..."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "No, you didn\u2019t. Sick of you and your\u2014ooh\u2014", "body": "..."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "...", "body": "It\u2019s all right. Andy approved it."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren\u2019t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?", "body": "Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley\u2019s got way more body fat than they do."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "You gave him three shots.", "body": "Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. Grab his feet. Let\u2019s go!"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "All right.", "body": "Move it! One, two, three."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.", "body": "Yes."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Any good weekend plans?", "body": "I might see a movie."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Nice.", "body": "What about you?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Uh, I don\u2019t know yet.", "body": "Let\u2019s take him\u2014"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I was thinking about\u2026", "body": "Let\u2019s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "And then what?", "body": "Okay, listen. I\u2019m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I\u2019ve never actually done this before."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Well, if I may, you\u2019re a natural.", "body": "Thank you. I mean, I\u2019ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh\u2026"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "That\u2019s a little weird.", "body": "I know. Evel Knievel."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "That\u2019s about as good as that\u2019s gonna be.", "body": "Okay, now here\u2019s the plan. I\u2019m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Catch?", "body": "Yeah."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "I can\u2019t catch him. He\u2019s like, 250 pounds.", "body": "You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He\u2019s gonna be moving slowly. It\u2019s only\u2014"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Blunt?", "body": "It\u2019s 15 feet down, it\u2019s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it\u2019s like your catching a medicine\u2014"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Dude, this size of my haunches\u2014", "body": "Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.", "body": "You okay?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "We can\u2019t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.", "body": "Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that\u2019s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "That\u2019s actually really smart.", "body": "Thank you."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.", "body": "Let\u2019s get him inside."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Hey, wait, wait, how\u2014how are we doing this?", "body": "Well, I\u2019ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Just say \u201carms\u201d and \u201clegs,\u201d okay? That just\u2014that\u2019s the vernacular that I\u2019m comfortable with.", "body": "Fine, let\u2019s go."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Aw, come on.", "body": "Get in."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Pigeons.", "body": "Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we\u2019ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Isn\u2019t the client, like, best friends with his sister?", "body": "New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let\u2019s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let\u2019s go."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Stanley, what is going on here?", "body": "He\u2019s fine. He gets carsick really easily."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Driving.", "body": "It\u2019s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we\u2019re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Ooh-hoo, look at that baby\u2026", "body": "Stanley."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Very special little boy.", "body": "Look at him. I\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful child."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he\u2019ll go, \u201ceee.\u201d", "body": "Like this? Watch."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?", "body": "You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn\u2019t even know it. I\u2019ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. Silly me. Gotta take the stairs."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Oh, no, I\u2019m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.", "body": "Well\u2014no, no\u2014n\u2014"}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yes!", "body": "Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself?"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Uh huh.", "body": "Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it\u2019s in the rules that you have to fold your own plane."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Oh man.", "body": "I call for a refold!"}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "This is flatter.", "body": "It\u2019s a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane."}

{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow.", "body": "I like a little feather in my nuggets."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Is there a reason that we\u2019re excited for that little woman?", "body": "Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything."}
{"character": "Dwight", "title": "Oh. Is she a gambler?", "body": "In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song."}

{"character": "Jim", "title": "You know, there\u2019s no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don\u2019t say anything about it.", "body": "Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?"}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "No, we can do it during the day. It doesn\u2019t have to be that dramatic, Jim.", "body": "Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options."}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "Jim, don\u2019t take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?", "body": "It\u2019s hard to tell so far."}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "You use your brain too much.", "body": "I\u2019m sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?"}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "Sometimes the smartest people don\u2019t think at all.", "body": "You just came up with that."}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "As I was saying it.", "body": "Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro\u2013 everyone gets a little bit."}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "Con\u2013 you look like a nerd.", "body": "Con\u2013 no one gets as much as they did last year."}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "Pro\u2013 you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.", "body": "Pro\u2013 no favoritism."}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "That will not go over well.", "body": "I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. \u2018Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us\u2026"}

{"character": "Jim", "title": "Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!", "body": "No, it\u2019s because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!"}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "Okay. Well, why don\u2019t you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don\u2019t you enliven me?", "body": "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re good at making tough decisions!"}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "Ah.", "body": "At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it\u2019s an unpopular decision."}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "Okay, here\u2019s a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!", "body": "But maybe I\u2019m here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I\u2019ve been sitting out there, and I\u2019ve been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table."}

{"character": "Jim", "title": "This had better be terrible.", "body": "Could I have everyone\u2019s attention, please? I have some tough news, so I\u2019m just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won\u2019t. Now, what we\u2019ve decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff."}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "Wait. Seriously?!", "body": "Look, you guys are smart, so I\u2019m just leveling with you. I\u2019m just trying to treat you like adults."}

{"character": "Jim", "title": "Well?", "body": "Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office."}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!", "body": "Okay, Dwight, you know what? You\u2019d be getting the raise so\u2013"}

{"character": "Jim", "title": "You\u2019re not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct\u2026", "body": "Thank you, Meredith."}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "What about a raise based on merit?", "body": "Rank each person individually?"}
{"character": "Jim", "title": "Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.", "body": "Well, obviously. Too bad he\u2019s a temp and doesn\u2019t count, so let\u2019s get started."}

{"character": "Jim", "title": "Usually a ten, but I\u2019m feeling like a zero.", "body": "I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?"}

Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I\u2019ve ever had to do\u2026 which was just to wait. Uh, don\u2019t get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn\u2019t need your help that many times.

So\u2026 I would like to propose a toast. So if you\u2019d all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses\u2013"}

She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn\u2019t. She shouldn\u2019t because she\u2019s an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That\u2019s not true. I\u2013 no.

{"character": "Pam", "title": "No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn\u2019t a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.", "body": "Yeah?"}
